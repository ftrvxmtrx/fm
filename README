fm
===
fm provides a gui to select an item from a list using a fuzzy matching algorithm.
When an item is selected, it is sent to the plumber `send` port unless the `-p` option
is used in which case the item name is printed on standard output and the application exits.

Usage:
-------
Install with usual ``mk install``
Sample use: ``walk -f | fm``

The provided `b` script gives a usage example.

Credits:
---------
The fuzzy matching algorithm has been ported from:
